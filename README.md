# Weather Station using LilyGo T-Display S3 with BME280 sensor data integrated.
Taking inspiration from the amazing work done by VolosR I have updated the code to both display values from a BME280 sensor as well as integrate a webserver whilst still getting and displaying a lot of online data on the webserver.

## Parts used:
